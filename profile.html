BUTTON, YOU OR THE ENTITY OR COMPANY THAT YOU REPRESENT ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT. YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND THE SERVICES OFFERED BY MEGATECHTRONIUM IN ANY MANNER SHALL ALSO CONSTITUTE ASSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHT TO USE THE SITE OR THE SERVICES DESCRIBED HEREIN. YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND/OR SERVICES IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON YOUR ASSENT TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS; IF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER BY MEGATECHTRONIUM, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THESE TERMS.</p>

					<p>The Web pages available at www.pownce.com and all linked pages ("Site"), are owned and operated by Megatechtronium, Inc. ("Megatechtronium"), and are accessed by you ("User") under the following terms and conditions.</p>

					<p>Megatechtronium reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify the Agreement or Services (as defined below) or Content (as defined below) at any time by posting a notice on the Site, or by sending User a notice via email or postal mail. User shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Use of the Services by User following such notification constitutes User's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.</p>

					<h3>ACCESS TO THE SERVICES (H3)</h3>
					<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Megatechtronium may offer to provide certain services and content solely for User's personal, non-commercial use, as described more fully on the Site, and which are selected by User through the process provided on the Site ("Services"). Services shall include, but not be limited to, any services Megatechtronium performs for User, as well as the offering of any materials displayed or performed on the Site (including, but not limited to diagrams, text, graphics, news articles, photographs, images, illustrations, audio clips and video clips, also known as the "Content") on the Site. Megatechtronium may change, suspend or discontinue the Services including any Content for any reason, at any time, including the availability of any feature, database, or content. Megatechtronium may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict User's access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. User shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to, access the Site or otherwise use the Services.</p>

					<p>User certifies to Megatechtronium that if User is an individual (i.e., not a corporation or institution) User is of legal age to form a binding contract. User also certifies that it is legally permitted to use the Services and access the Site, and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services and access of the Site. Without limiting the foregoing, if User is under the age of 13, User is not allowed to use the Services. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Site is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>

					<h4>SITE CONTENT (H4)</h4>
					<p>The Site is protected by copyright as a collective work and/or compilation, pursuant to U.S. copyright laws, international conventions, and other copyright laws. User may not use, modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer, license or sale of, reproduce (except as provided in this section of the Agreement), create derivative works based on, distribute, perform, display, or in any way exploit, any of the Content, software, materials, third party submissions, Services, or other proprietary rights not owned by User in whole or in part (i) without the express prior written consent of the respective owners, and (ii) in any way that violates any third party right. User shall abide by all copyright notices, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Services.</p>

User shall not store any significant portion of any Content in any form. Copying or storing of any Content for other than personal, non-commercial use is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from Megatechtronium, or from the copyright holder (e.g. the person identified in such Content's copyright notice).</p>

					<p>In the course of using the Services, User and other users may provide information which may be used by Megatechtronium in connection with the Site or Services and which may be visible to certain other users. Megatechtronium does not claim ownership rights in any original Content that User chooses to post to the Site or send using the Services.

User understands, consents and agrees that by uploading, displaying, publishing, posting or otherwise submitting information, materials or content to Megatechtronium or through the Site (collectively, "User Submissions"), User hereby does and shall grant Megatechtronium a non exclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable and transferable right and license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform and display, modify, publish and otherwise fully exploit such User Submissions (including all related intellectual property and moral rights) in connection with the Site, Services and Megatechtronium's (and its successor and assigns) business. User also hereby does and shall grant each user of the Site a non-exclusive license to access User Submissions through the Site and to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Site and under this Agreement. Further, Megatechtronium may make User Submissions available for download by User, other users and the general public, and allow other users and the general public to download such User Submissions in accordance with the sharing and download options User specifies in the upload form for the applicable content file. If User has posted User Submissions to the Site prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement, as modified, User acknowledges and agrees that such User Submissions will only be so downloadable if User requests such service on an upload form for that content file.</p>

					<p>User understands that all content, material, and information publicly posted or privately transmitted or otherwise accessible through the Site is the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated and that Megatechtronium will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any Content or any loss or damage of any kind incurred in connection with use of or exposure to any Content posted, emailed, accessed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services.

					<h6>INDEMNITY.</h6>
					<p>User will indemnify and hold Megatechtronium, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees, harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of User's access to the Site, use of the Services, the violation of this Agreement by User, or the infringement by User, or any third party using User's account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.</p>

					<h6>TERMINATION.</h6>

Upon termination of User's account, User's right to use the Services, access the Site and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification and limitations of liability.</p>

					<h6>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND INTERACTIONS.</h6>
					<p>The Site may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Megatechtronium. When User accesses third party websites, it does so at its own risk. Megatechtronium encourages User to be aware when it leaves the Site and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website that User visits.

					<p>User's interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service are solely between User and such organizations and/or individuals. User should make whatever investigation it feels necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. User agrees that Megatechtronium shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between participants on the Site, or between User and any third party, User understands and agrees that Megatechtronium is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that User has a dispute with one or more other users, User hereby releases Megatechtronium, its officers, employees, agents and successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our service. If User is a California resident, User waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>

					<h6>MISCELLANEOUS.</h6>
					<p>The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Megatechtronium shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Megatechtronium's reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by User except with Megatechtronium's prior written consent. Megatechtronium may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and User does not have any authority of any kind to bind Megatechtronium in any respect whatsoever.</p>
